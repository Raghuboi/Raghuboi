### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer with experience developing and shipping web applications for startups. I am highly flexible working across the stack and adapting to new technologies. My experience lies in using technologies such as Typescript, GraphQL, tRPC, NodeJS, React (NextJS), React Native, Postgres, Java, Python, and Docker. I have degrees in Computer Science and Economics and I enjoy blending my economic knowledge with my technical skills to create well-rounded user-centric solutions.

These days I am trying to contribute more to open source and implement TDD in my own projects. I am looking to bring my experience to a growing company and contribute to its growth journey while continuously learning and expanding my skill set.
